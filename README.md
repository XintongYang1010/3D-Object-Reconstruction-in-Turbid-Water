# 3D-Object-Reconstruction-in-Turbid-Water
We propose underwater 3D structured-light reconstruction in turbid water using temporal-multiplexed fringes and polarization. Four polarization angles give Stokes S2 and DoP cues. A turbidity-removal network with fringe-capture and global-contour blocks restores fringes and edges, yielding denser, more accurate geometry than prior methods.
